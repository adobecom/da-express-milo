When updating plan view, LOE, assignees, or Jira-related info:
- **Update only the docs** (e.g. PLAN_VIEW_V2.md, dev/*.md).
- **Commit** the doc changes (git add + commit).
- **Do not** change Jira via API (no assignee, timetracking, or field updates in Jira). Jira is updated separately by the team when needed.
